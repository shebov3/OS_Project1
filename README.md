# GoLang REST API With Kubernetes Helm Chart EXAMPLE Project

## A fully functional EXAMPLE project written in Go showing how to create a REST API and deploy to Kubernetes!

This project is an example that was built along with a Youtube Series showing how to create a custom REST API in Golang. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

- Create a custom web server with Golang using HTTPRouter
- Create a simple REST API that serves Youtube stats (as an example use case)
- Automatically containerize and push a Docker container to Docker hub using Github Actions
- Create a Kubernetes Helm chart for deploying your API to Kubernetes
- Push your Helm chart to a Helm Chart repo using Github Actions and Github Pages (coming soon)
- How to write a good README (you are reading it now!)

## How to install this example Golang project on Kubernetes

The easiest way to see how this works is to watch the series, but here's the short version.

1. clone this project
2. Set up a local kubernetes cluster - https://askcloudarchitech.com/posts/tutorials/local-kubernetes-startup-script/
3. Install helm - `brew install helm`
4. Setup your keys - see the video here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0L_yR30PqI&list=PLSvCAHoiHC_rqKbcu1ummWVpLTDBNZHH7&index=5
5. Install with Helm

## How to tweak this project for your own uses

Since this is an example project, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use for your own puposes. It's a good starter boilerplate
